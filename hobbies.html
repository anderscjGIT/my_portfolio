					I have never really took much of a interest in writing as a child or even in highschool. Only recently have I taken a vested interest in the subject.  I mainly blog, journal, and post comments online.  The main subject of my interest usually evolves around betterment. Basically self development. It is kind of an addictive topic, since there are a plethora of active blogs, and communities online which are interested in the same subject.

						I have always enjoyed drawing as a child, and I continued drawing up until the end of highschool.  After graduating, I seem to have dropped the hobby altogether.  Only recently have I become interested in learning more about this subject again. I have found that this creative outlet reduces stress, and allows my creative side to explore new ideas.

						I have always been active throughout the younger years of my life, though entering into my thirties, exercise had dropped to the wayside. Joining a gym recently has reinvigorated my enjoyment of exercise, and staying in shape. A major plus about living in the NorthWest is that there are so man extracurricular activities, such as biking, hiking, skiing...ect.
