       Not long ago, I was looking for a hobby where I could use my hands and mind to create something unique. I tried poetry writing but that soon fizzled out, and I gave painting a shot, but this too did not last long. By accident I stumbled upon pottery class that was open to new pottery students at a local studio. It did  not take long before I was hooked. I believe the only way to find a hobby that fits you, is a combination of a little self awareness and exploring what truly interests you.

      There are many benefits that I have found to having a hobby that is truly enjoyable. The main benefit that I found out shortly after attending the pottery class is that my stress was reduced considerably. Even though the class was only held once at week, it provided a psychological break from my work life. Instead of thinking about work, even on the weekends, I was forcing myself to focus on molding and shaping a unique creation out of clay.

    <p> 
     The basic steps to making pottery are pretty straight forward. Firstly, you will need to procure the type of clay of your choice.  There are different types of clays, and each has its own unique consistency and character. Once you have your clay, you will want to work it over in your hands, so that it's uniform. This can be done by rolling, and mixing. Centering your piece of clay on the pottery wheel is the next step in this process. While working with your piece, you can gradually make a indentation in the center the clay, slowly hollowing the center out with your hands. Once your piece is complete, you can use a steel wire to release your piece from the pottery wheel, sliding the wire under the base of your completed piece.

     Store the piece for 1-2 days, under a plastic or burlap cover. This is to slowly dry out the pottery piece. Once this time has passed, store on a shelf till the pottery is bone dry. The piece will then be fired in a kiln.
